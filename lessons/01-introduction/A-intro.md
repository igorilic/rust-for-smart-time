## Why Rust?

There are more than a few reasons to learn rust, but I will give you my top 3:

1. **Performance** - Rust is a systems programming language, and it is designed
   to be fast. It is designed to be fast in a way that is safe, and that is
   what makes it special.

2. **Safety** - Rust is designed to be safe. It is designed to be safe in a way

3. **Ergonomics** - Rust designers are very focused on making the language
   easy to use. They are constantly improving the language to make it easier
   to use.

#### **Ergonomics**

This seems like every tweeter thread is mentions something with developer
ergonomics. but what in the world are they always talking about?

For me, ergonomics is defined on two axes, one quickly being able to write
software with low unexpected behavior, and two, maintain software longer

#### **Rust**

There are many deep topics within the language itself that it takes
significantly more time to master each of these. To me this makes me excited
because there are a lot of ways you can improve how you write software

I have explicitly planned one such of these adventures to show some of the
power of knowing rusts std and traits

The language is simply deeper itself, not just use of libraries. You have
complete control over where and how memory is used, and this can lead to some
very cool things.
